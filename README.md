## Dependencies
* MATLAB (for running Gauss-Newton inverse solver). Make sure the folder ``starn`` is in your Matlab search path, set by running ``startup.m``
* Python (for training your own model and evaluation). Quick installation of conda environment: ``conda env create -f environment.yml``

## Running
All the commands below can also be found in ``run_example.m``. They are all run in MATLAB, except the training of model.
### Run the Gauss-Newton inverse solver with a pretrained model
Solve an inverse problem whose initial guess provided by a pretrained model is stored already
```
starn_inverse_singlefreq(1, 'nn_stored', './pretrained/star10_kh10_n48/valid_predby_pretrained.mat');
```

Solve an inverse problem whose initial guess is obtained by calling a pretrained model (:warning: requiring a file named "env_path.txt" in the current directory providing the location to python binary file, like the absolute path to '~/miniconda3/envs/invscatnn/bin/python')
```
starn_inverse_singlefreq(1, 'nn', './pretrained/star10_kh10_n48/pretrained');
```

Solve an inverse problem with zero initial guess
```
starn_inverse_singlefreq(1, 'random', './configs/nc3.json');
```
### Run the linear sampling method to solve an inverse problem
```
starn_lsm_fft(1, './configs/nc10.json');
```
### Run the whole pipeline of data generation, training, inverse solving on a small dataset
Step 1: data generation
```
starn_data_generation(-1, './configs/nc3.json');
```
Step 2: training, run the python file ``train.py``, making sure all the dependencies are installed

Step 3: inverse solving
```
starn_inverse_singlefreq(1, 'nn', './data/star3_kh10_n48_100/test');
```
